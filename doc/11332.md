# 11332 Summing Digits

### Description

```
For a positive integer n, let f(n) denote the
sum of the digits of n when represented in base
10. It is easy to see that the sequence of numbers n, f(n), f(f(n)), f(f(f(n))), . . . eventually
becomes a single digit number that repeats forever. Let this single digit be denoted g(n).
For example, consider n = 1234567892.
Then:
f(n) = 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+2 = 47
f(f(n)) = 4 + 7 = 11
f(f(f(n))) = 1 + 1 = 2
Therefore, g(1234567892) = 2.
```

### Input

```
Each line of input contains a single positive integer n at most 2,000,000,000. Input is terminated
by n = 0 which should not be processed.
```

### Output

```
For each such integer, you are to output a single
line containing g(n).
```

### Sample Input

```
2
11
47
1234567892
0
```

### Sample Output

```
2
2
2
2
```

### 中文解說

```
將輸入的數字透過給定的演算法做運算
```

### 解題說明

```
透過遞迴的方式實現演算法,只有當結果為單個的時候才回傳,不然就丟新的值進去繼續遞迴
```

### 解題原始碼

```python
def Summing(x):
    total = 0
    for ch in x:
        total += int(ch)
    if (total <= 9): return total 
    else: return Summing(str(total))

def main():
    while(1):
        x = input()
        if (x == "0"): break
        print(Summing(x))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

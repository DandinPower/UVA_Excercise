# 10035 Primary Arithmetic

### Description

```
Children are taught to add multi-digit numbers from right-to-left one digit at a time. Many find the
“carry” operation - in which a 1 is carried from one digit position to be added to the next - to be a
significant challenge. Your job is to count the number of carry operations for each of a set of addition
problems so that educators may assess their difficulty.
```

### Input

```
Each line of input contains two unsigned integers less than 10 digits. The last line of input contains ‘0
0’.
```

### Output

```
For each line of input except the last you should compute and print the number of carry operations
that would result from adding the two numbers, in the format shown below.
```

### Sample Input

```
123 456
555 555
123 594
0 0
```

### Sample Output

```
No carry operation.
3 carry operations.
1 carry operation
```

---

### 中文解說

```
需要計算相加後進位了幾次
```

### 解題說明

```
透過將原本較大的去比較相加玩的結果，如果該位有進位則結果的位數會小於原本的位數
```

### 解題原始碼

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

string Format(int a){
    if (a == 0) return "No";
    else return to_string(a);
}

int Max(int a, int b){
    if (a >= b) return a;
    else return b;
}

int GetCarryOperation(int result,int larger){
    int total = 0;
    while(1){
        int a = larger%10;
        int b = result%10;
        if (b < a) total += 1;
        larger = larger/10;
        result = result/10;
        if (larger == 0)break; 
    }
    return total;
}

int main(void){
    int a, b;
    while(1){
        cin >> a >> b;
        if (a == 0 & b == 0) break;
        int result = a + b;
        cout << Format(GetCarryOperation(result,Max(a,b))) << " carry operation."<<endl;
    }
    return 0;
}

### Description

```
Hashmat is a brave warrior who with his group of young soldiers moves from one place to another to
fight against his opponents. Before Fighting he just calculates one thing, the difference between his
soldier number and the opponent’s soldier number. From this difference he decides whether to fight or
not. Hashmat’s soldier number is never greater than his opponent.

### 解題說明

```
需要特別注意的是因為輸入的限制為2^32，所以如果用int來計算會爆，因此採用long來計算
```

### 解題程式碼

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

long Abs(long a){
    if (a >= 0) return a;
    else return -a;
}

int main(void){
    while(1){
        long a,b;
        cin >> a >> b;
        cout << Abs(a - b) << endl;
    }
}
